Based on the data example given in the prompt, I treated the team win–loss records as a matrix, where each row represents a team and each column represents that team’s record against another team. The function first sorts the team names so it matches how the sample table looks (alphabetical order). Using a nested loop, the outer loop selects the current team (row), while the inner loop iterates over all opponents (columns). If the team is compared to itself, "--" is inserted; otherwise, the number of wins against the opposing team is pulled from the data and added to the row.

Finally, all rows are combined into a formatted string that represents the complete head-to-head table.
